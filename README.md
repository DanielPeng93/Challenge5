# Challenge5:	Find	the	Arduino

Challenge 5 of the EC544 course in Fall 2015 at Boston University

Task:	create	a	system	that	localizes	a	mobile	Arduino/Xbee (on	a	person	or	
vehicle) in	an	indoor	environment.	The	results	should	be	displayed	graphically	in	
real	time	on	a	host	computer	display	that	is	not	directly	connected	to	a	spot.	

Deliverables:	 Presentation summarizing	design	decisions,	architecture	and	data	
flow	of	solution,	demonstration	of	solution.	

Learning	objectives: learn	the	different	strategies	for	indoor	localization	
(positioning);	adaptation	of	these	strategies	to	the	XBees	and	available	sensors.
